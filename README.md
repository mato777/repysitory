A python package for creating and managing sql repositories.

## GOAL
The goal of this package is to provide a simple way to create and manage sql repositories. 
It is designed to be simple and easy to use, while still providing the necessary functionality to manage sql repositories.
It is going to be very opinionated and in some cases a well custom written sql statement will be enough to solve your custom problem.

## Special thanks
To my beautiful wife and kids for their support and patience during the development of this package.
To AI Agents to help me write the code and documentation.

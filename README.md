# Repysitory

A python package for creating and managing sql repositories.

## GOAL
The goal of this package is to provide a simple way to create and manage sql repositories. 
It is designed to be simple and easy to use, while still providing the necessary functionality to manage sql repositories.
It is going to be very opinionated and in some cases a well custom written sql statement will be enough to solve your custom problem.
